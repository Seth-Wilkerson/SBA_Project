# SBA_Project
This project is for the HTML/CSS/JS SBA.
I made a 3 page website that has a sign in page, about page, and content page.
The content page allows the user to enter a income/budget,
and add as many expenses as they want.
It then displays the income, total expenses, and net income.
The sign page lets the user enter name, email, and country
then it displays the info in a table.
The about page displays some info abnout the site and a link to my GitHub.
